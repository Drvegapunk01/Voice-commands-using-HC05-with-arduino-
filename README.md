This initial version doesn't have many keywords yet, but you can add as many as you like,
in this project there is a relay that is connected to pin 3 of the Arduino Uno then hc05 which is connected to the RX tx pin
Note: This tool will reset the buffer every 10 seconds to avoid data accumulation, so if you mispronounce the word you will have to wait a few seconds.
